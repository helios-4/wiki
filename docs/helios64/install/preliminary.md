!!! note
    Go to [Kit Assembly](/helios64/kit/) to find out how to assemble your Helios64 enclosure kit.

## Requirement

What you need before you start:

**1. microSD Card<br>**
You need a microSD Card UHS-I with a minimum capacity of 8GB to be able to flash Helios64 image.

We recommend the following models:

- SanDisk Extreme microSDHC UHS-I Card (32GB)
- SanDisk Extreme PRO microSDHC UHS-I Card (32GB)
- Strontium Nitro MicroSD Card (16GB)
- Samsung microSDHC UHS-I Card EVO Plus (32GB)

## Install Options

Helios64 supports two OS installation options :

1. [Install OS on eMMC Flash](/helios64/install/emmc/)

    Recommended if you know already what system setup you need.

2. [Install OS on microSD Card](/helios64/install/sdcard/)

    Good if you want to experiment first and/or test different OS image versions.
    You will still be able to migrate your OS on eMMC Flash without redoing a fresh install.

**Note:** We will introduce additional install options in the new future.

If you are facing an issue, you can go on the **Armbian** forum to ask for some help. There is a thread dedicated to [Helios64 support](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/15431-helios64-support/).
